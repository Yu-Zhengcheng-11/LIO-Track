In this paper, we propose LIO-Track, a tightly-coupled LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) with Multiple Object tracking (MOT) system that achieves object tracking together with Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) and obtains better pose estimation accuracy. We formulate the whole LIO-MOT problem in a hierarchical factor graph optimization and adopt different association and optimization strategies for objects moving quickly and slowly to hold the uniqueness of the same tracking object. We design a novel Error State Kalman Filter (ESKF) for successfully associated objects that take observation from ego pose and detection results. Considering the spatial-temporal correlation of dynamic objects, we build a spatial-temporal corridor for each object and use this corridor to filter dynamic object points. Meanwhile, we represent object spatial information as a normal distribution and use divergence between normal distributions to measure the difference between objects. Experiments on the KITTI dataset verify the strength of our approach compared to the open-source state-of-the-art approach. We also validate our proposed framework in real-world environments.
